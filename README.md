# FYSSP100

All relevant/final scripts are stored in FYSSP100/tarball/11/code/11_1/categorized code. 

The main files used in the project are
  finding_opt_window.C, 
  estimatingSim.C, 
  test_statistic.C  and 
  discoveryAndExlusion.C

significance_luminosity2.C is used to generate the 4-panel plot illustrating how the significance increases with 
an increase in luminosity.

lum_and_sig3.C is used to plot significance vs luminosity. To run it, you need to first have loaded finding_opt_window.C 
(by use of ".L finding_opt_window.C" in root). 

The additional aCliC file etc. needs to be stored in the same directory as the main files listed above in order for them to run.
